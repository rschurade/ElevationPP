/// Elevated variant of the root <see cref="TrainStationRootProto"/> — the base building that
/// establishes a train station and that loading modules attach to. Reuses the vanilla root model
/// and config but with an elevated track trajectory, a widened placement-height range, and a
/// UsingPillar footprint, so it can be raised onto pillars like the elevated loading module.
///
/// The root entity (<c>TrainStationRoot</c>) is sealed, so unlike the loading module this proto
/// cannot supply an <see cref="ITrainTrackMayBeElevatedFriend"/> entity. Crucially, that means it
/// must NOT implement <c>ITrainTrackMayBeElevatedProto</c>: the placement command routes any such
/// proto through a path that casts the new entity to <c>ITrainTrackMayBeElevatedFriend</c> and
/// rejects it ("entity is not elevated") when the cast fails. Instead the root is elevated purely
/// as a layout entity on its footprint pillars via <see cref="ILayoutEntityProtoWithElevation"/>,
/// like a balancer. It is never collapse-checked (only friends are), so it holds.
